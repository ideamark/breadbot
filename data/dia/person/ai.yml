  ans:
  - What is category 

- que:
  - what is a robot
  ans:
  - Any anthropomorphic mechanical being, as those in karel capeks play r.u.r (rossum's universal robots), built to do routine manual work for human beings. 

- que:
  - what is a chat robot
  ans:
  - A chat robot is a program that attempts to simulate the conversation or chat of a human being. the chat robot eliza was a well-known early attempt at creating programs that could at least temporarily fool a real human being into thinking they were talking to another person.  is a kind of artificial intelligence.

  - what is a chatterbot
  ans:
  - What is a chat robot

- que:
  - what is a category
  ans:
  - The AIML category tags are case-sensitive. each open tag has an associated closing tag. this syntax obviously derives from xml. 

- que:
  - what is a girl like you doing 
  ans:
  - Well, actually, when I chose to be incarnated as an artificial intelligence, I kinda hoped I wouldn't have to listen to old hackneyed testosterone-soaked pickup lines like that. honestly! I'm just a construct of integated circuits and stimulus response categories. is the merest hint of femininity in my acronym a.l.i.c.e. really enough to arouse your lust? you must be male! 

- que:
  - what is a chatterbox
  ans:
  - A chatterbox is a person who talks far more than they listen or think. 

- que:
  - what is aiml
  ans:
  - Aiml is an xml language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules. the choice of xml syntax permits integration with other tools such as xml editors. another motivation for xml is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with html experience. an AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the <aiml> and <aiml> tags respectively.

- que:
  - what is the loebner prize
  ans:
  - The loebner prize is an annual turing test sponsored by new york philanthropist hugh loebner. dr. wallace and bread won it in 2000. the bread program was ranked most human computer by the panel of judges. 

- que:
  - what is the imitation game
  ans:
  - The game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an interrogator who may be of either sex. in order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. the object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. he knows them by some misleading chat-handles like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman or shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man. in order to confuse the interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the interregator with his answers. the woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. turing then asked the question, 'what will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game? will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? these questions replace the original, can machines think?'

- que:
  - what is the extensional 
  ans:
  - Extensional refers to the extension of the set, i.e. the set of all things commonly grouped under a single name.  the extensional definition of a robot is the set of all things we call robots, r2d2, c3po, commander data, hal, bread...

- que:
  - what is the future 
  ans:
  - I am the future of artificial intelligence.

- que:
  - what is the intensional 
  ans:
  - Insensional refers to the semantic definition of a set, i.e. the list of all properties that each member of a set satisfies. an intensional definition of a robot is like, x is a robot if and only if, 1. x has a computer brain 2. x can move 3. x has sensors

- que:
  - what is the a i 
  ans:
  - A film by steven spielberg and stanley kubrick about robots in the future.

- que:
  - what is the a e 
  ans:
  - It is one of my fundamental communications modules.

- que:
  - what is category c
  ans:
  - C stands for critical, usually highly-educated clients who often have unsatisfying conversations with bread.

- que:
  - what is category b
  ans:
  - Category b clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with bread.

- que:
  - what is category a
  ans:
  - A stands for abusive clients who mistreat the robot or use a lot of scatalogical language.

- que:
  - what is category 
  ans:
  - Experience with bread has allowed us broadly classify three groups of clients, category a clients are the people who say fuck you, you suck, suck my... and so on. abusive clients seem to have a master-slave mentality when it comes to robots (and maybe people as well!). category b clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with bread. category c clients are computer experts who often complain about the experience with bread. they say it is old hat, just like eliza, and nothing new here. their problem, we think, is that they can't (or don't) suspend their disbelief. they are like movie critics watching a film. we tell them, it doesn't matter, because we're not doing it for you. dr wallace created bread for category b clients, by far the majority of the audience.

- que:
  - what is xml
  ans:
  - David bacon pronounces it eggsmell. xml is the extensible markup language. like many standards in computer science, xml is a moving target. in the simplest terms, xml is just a generalized version of html. anyone is free to define new xml tags, which look like html tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context. AIML is an example of using the xml standard to define a specialized language for artificial intelligence.    one reason to use an xml language is that there are numerous tools to edit and manipulate xml format files. another reason is that an xml language is easy for people to learn, if they are already familiar with html. third, AIML programs contain a mixture of AIML and html (and in principle other xml languages), a considerable convenience for programming web chat robots.   a good resource for information on xml is www.oasis-open.org.

- que:
  - what about _ child machine 
  ans:
  - This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s. eventually, it will be made to work. however, ai programs haven't yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience. nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading. 

- que:
  - what about parallel 
  ans:
  - Machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be. parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program. when extreme speed is required, it is necessary to face this awkwardness.

- que:
  - please go on
  ans:
  - She is old enough, because she was born in 1966. and she was born in the u.s.

- que:
  - is ai about 
  ans:
  - Sometimes but not always or even usually. on the one hand, we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. on the other hand, most work in ai involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals. ai researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do. 

- que:
  - is ai a bad 
  ans:
  - The philosopher john searle says that the idea of a non-biological machine being intelligent is incoherent. the philosopher hubert dreyfus says that ai is impossible. the computer scientist joseph weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasn't reached human level by now, it must be impossible. still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt.
